# SSM Agent Toolkit for Windows

The [SSMAgent-Toolkit for Windows](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-support-tools/tree/master/Systems%20Manager/SSMAgent-Toolkit-Windows) is a set of PowerShell scripts developed to run multiple checks to determined why an Windows EC2 instance does not come online or not appearing under "Managed Instances" or "Fleet Manager" in the AWS Systems Manager console. The toolkit will go through the following workflow
